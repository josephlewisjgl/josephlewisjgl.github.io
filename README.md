<h2> Welcome to my site! </h2>

Hi! I'm Joseph Lewis and I am currently a Senior Data Scientist working at the Welsh Government. I have almost 5 years of experience working in Data Science having completed a degree apprenticeship while working full time 2019-2021. I have a range of experience working on natural language problems like topic modelling as well as operational research problems like using network theory.

Data Science isn't just something I do in my 9-5! One of the things I'm proudest of and some of my most recent highlights have come from my blog. I have over 20 posts on Medium and a rapidly growing audience. Some things I have written about lately are: <br>
<ul>
<li>
  Using PyTorch for Object Detection and Classification for animation frames from the Simpsons published in Geek Culture
</li>
<li>
  Building a simulated theme park using Discrete Event Simulation in R. Published in Towards Data Science.
</li>
<li>
  Using Graph Neural Networks to recommend new anime for me to watch! Published in Towards Data Science.

</ul>
