## Personal life!
<br>
Whilst it may sound like all I do is data science from the above, it really isn't! Outside of all of that, I enjoy playing guitar, reading and playing videogames. I live near Bristol with my girlfriend, Miranda and our cat Socks, who both put up with me spending far too much time on this laptop.
