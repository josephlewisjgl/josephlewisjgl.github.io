Hi! I'm Joseph Lewis and I am currently a Senior Data Scientist working at the Welsh Government. I have almost 5 years of experience working in Data Science having completed a degree apprenticeship while working full time 2019. I have a range of experience working on natural language problems like topic modelling as well as operational research problems like using network theory.

Data Science isn't just something I do in my 9-5! One of the things I'm proudest of and some of my most recent highlights have come from my blog. I have over 20 posts on Medium and a rapidly growing audience. Some things I have written about lately are: <br>
  * Using PyTorch for Object Detection and Classification for animation frames from the Simpsons
  * Building a simulated theme park using Discrete Event Simulation in R
  * Using Graph Neural Networks to recommend new anime for me to watch!

Thank you to everyone who has read, enjoyed and subscribed to my content and if you haven't already check it out on [Medium](https://medium.com/@josephgeorgelewis2000).

I am also the proud co-author of StatsWalesPy the Python package for interacting with Welsh Government Open Data on the StatsWales statistics portal for Wales. For more information about this project check out the [Python Package Index page](https://pypi.org/project/statswalespy/).
