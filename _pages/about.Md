I am a full time Senior Data Scientist with the Welsh Government and some of my areas of interest are:
* Unsupervised machine learning
* Reproducible analytical pipelines
* Topic modelling
* Synthetic data

All of the above and other data science problems often involve the use of Python and R but I also do a lot of my own data engineering using SQL.

Data Science isn't just something for work! I have also started my own Data Science Blog with a range of different articles published. I post explainers, how-to's as well as more indepth project walkthroughs for whatever has captured my interest. Some of the recent topics are:
* Graph neural networks
* Discrete event simulation
* Computer vision
* Stable diffusion

My articles appear in a few different publications like Towards Data Science, Level up Coding and Geek Culture. Luckily, all of these are on Medium, so to keep up to date please follow me there, using the link in the sidebar.

My introduction to Data Science was from my apprenticeship with the Welsh Government and Cardiff Metropolitan University. I took on the three-year apprenticeship, starting in 2019 to earn my First Class, BSc (Hons) Applied Data Science Degree in 2022. Some of the topics I covered were:
* Building neural networks from scratch
* Making impactful data visualisations
* Using PyTorch for modelling big datasets

As part of my degree I also authored my dissertation, titled 'The Application of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines in Government'. This is work I have gone on to present at cross-community networks and conferences.

Since then, I've taken on a Masters in Data Science and Analytics with Cardiff University. As part of this course I've extended my knowledge of the theoretical concepts behind some of the techniques I use in work and on my blog. This includes, and will include:
* Computational data science
* Foundations of statistics for data science
* Distributed computing and distributed systems

Whilst it may sound like all I do is data science from the above, it really isn't! Outside of all of that, I enjoy playing guitar and way too many videogames. I live near Bristol with my girlfriend, Miranda, who puts up with me spending far too much time on this laptop, and hopefully very soon multiple cats, one of which we will call Spooky.
