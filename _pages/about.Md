## My personal blog

Data Science isn't just something for work! I have also started my own Data Science Blog with a range of different articles published. I post explainers, how-to's as well as more indepth project walkthroughs for whatever has captured my interest. Some of the recent topics are:

## Personal life!

Whilst it may sound like all I do is data science from the above, it really isn't! Outside of all of that, I enjoy playing guitar, reading and playing videogames. I live near Bristol with my girlfriend, Miranda and our cat Socks, who both put up with me spending far too much time on this laptop.
